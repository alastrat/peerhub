You are Claude Code (or an equivalent senior full-stack engineer + product designer). Build a fully functional MVP for a 360° performance evaluation (multi-rater feedback) web app for SMBs.

HARD REQUIREMENTS
- Tech: Next.js 15 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS.
- Deploy: Vercel-ready (no custom servers).
- Database: Postgres (use Prisma ORM). Must run locally with Docker Compose and in production (Neon/Supabase compatible).
- Auth: NextAuth with Email magic links + Google OAuth (optional if time). Multi-tenant (each “Company” is a tenant).
- UI/UX: Must look premium and modern. Avoid generic SaaS templates. Use nike.com as the design benchmark: strong typography, whitespace, bold hero sections, clean cards, subtle motion, sharp micro-interactions. Use a neutral palette, focus on layout and type hierarchy. Use shadcn/ui components but heavily customized so it does not look default.
- MVP scope: Fully usable end-to-end with seed data and a guided onboarding.

PRODUCT GOAL
A multi-tenant 360 evaluation platform where HR admins create review cycles, participants nominate/assign raters, raters submit feedback, and the system generates individual reports and HR dashboards with anonymity thresholds.

PRIMARY ROLES
1) Super Admin (dev/testing only): can view all tenants, no UI needed beyond a simple page.
2) Company Admin (HR): manages org, cycles, templates, users, reporting.
3) Manager: can view team participation and reports (only for their direct reports).
4) Employee: self review, nominate raters, view own report when released.
5) Rater: can submit feedback for assigned reviews (may be internal or external via secure link).

MVP FEATURES (MUST IMPLEMENT)
A) Multi-tenant
- Company creation on signup (first user becomes Company Admin).
- All data scoped by companyId. Add middleware protection.
- Ability for Admin to invite users by email to company.

B) Org & people
- Users: name, email, title, department, managerId, role.
- Simple org import via CSV (upload) OR “Add users” UI form (choose one, but must exist).
- Departments: minimal table or enum-like list.

C) Review templates
- Template builder (Admin): create a template with sections:
  - Competencies (rating 1-5 + optional comment)
  - Values/Behaviors (rating 1-5 + comment)
  - Open-ended questions (text)
- Provide 2 professional default templates seeded.

D) Review cycles
- Create a cycle with: name, start date, due date, anonymity threshold (default 3 for peer/direct reports), enabled rater groups (self, manager, peers, direct reports, external).
- Select participants (employees) included in the cycle.
- For each participant:
  - self review auto-created
  - manager review auto-assigned (if managerId exists)
  - peers/direct reports: nomination workflow
  - optional admin override to add/remove raters
- Status tracking per participant: Not Started / In Progress / Complete / Released.

E) Nomination workflow
- Employee can nominate X peers (Admin sets min/max, default min 3 max 6).
- Manager/HR can approve nominations (simple “Approve all / remove” UI).
- Once approved, raters get emailed a secure link.
- External raters: add email/name, they receive link without needing an account.
- Anonymity: in the final report, peer/direct-report comments are grouped and not attributable; only show if group count >= threshold.

F) Rater experience
- Secure link-based access (token in DB with expiry, single-use optional).
- Clean evaluation form with autosave.
- Progress indicator and submit confirmation.
- Prevent multiple submissions.

G) Reports
- Individual report page for employee and admin/manager visibility rules:
  - Aggregated average by section and competency
  - Comparison: Self vs Others overall
  - Rater-group breakdown (Manager vs Peers vs Direct reports) where allowed
  - Thematic grouping of open-text comments: “Strengths” and “Opportunities” (simple heuristic: use question type mapping, no AI required)
- Release controls: Admin clicks “Release reports” for a cycle or per participant. Before release, employee can’t view report.

H) HR dashboards
- Cycle overview: participation rate, completion by rater group, late items.
- Drill-down: participant list with statuses and reminder buttons (email).
- Exports: CSV export of aggregated ratings and raw comments (raw comments only for Admin, still anonymized by group).

I) Notifications (email)
- Use Resend (or Postmark) with dev fallback (log emails to console).
- Emails:
  - Invite user
  - Rater request
  - Reminder
  - Report released

J) Onboarding & seed data
- After first login, show onboarding checklist:
  1) Add employees
  2) Create template
  3) Create cycle
  4) Launch (send rater emails)
- Seed a demo tenant + demo users + a sample cycle.

NON-GOALS (DO NOT BUILD)
- Payroll, compensation, complex calibrations, OKRs, SSO enterprise, complex analytics.
- AI summarization. Keep it deterministic and reliable.

SECURITY / PERMISSIONS (MUST)
- Use RLS-like enforcement at app layer:
  - Admin: everything in company
  - Manager: only direct reports’ cycle status + reports
  - Employee: only own nominations, own self review, and own report (after release)
  - Rater: only their assigned review via token
- Ensure every query is scoped by companyId.
- Secure token links: random 32+ bytes, hashed in DB, expiry default 14 days.

DATA MODEL (REQUIRED)
Use Prisma with these core tables (you can adjust fields but keep structure):
- Company
- User (companyId, role, managerId, department, title)
- Department (companyId, name)
- Template (companyId, name, jsonSchema)
- Cycle (companyId, templateId, startDate, dueDate, anonymityThreshold, status)
- CycleParticipant (cycleId, userId, status, releasedAt)
- ReviewAssignment (cycleId, participantId, raterType, raterUserId nullable, externalRaterEmail nullable, tokenId nullable, status)
- ReviewResponse (assignmentId, answersJson, submittedAt)
- Token (companyId, hashedToken, expiresAt, usedAt)

APP PAGES (MUST)
- Marketing-ish landing (logged-out) with premium design.
- Auth pages.
- App shell with left nav + top bar.
- Admin:
  - People (list, add, import)
  - Templates (list, builder)
  - Cycles (list, create, detail dashboard)
- Employee:
  - My reviews (self + pending as rater)
  - Nominations (per cycle)
  - My report (after release)
- Manager:
  - Team overview (direct reports status)
  - Direct report report pages
- Rater:
  - Token review page (no full app access)

DESIGN SYSTEM (MUST)
- Create a small design system: typography scale, spacing, buttons, inputs, cards, empty states.
- Use subtle motion (Framer Motion) in 2-3 places: onboarding checklist progress, cycle status transitions, submit success.
- Use icon set (lucide-react). No emoji-heavy UI.
- Create at least 3 polished empty states with helpful CTAs.

ENGINEERING QUALITY (MUST)
- Clean architecture with:
  - /app routes
  - /components
  - /lib (auth, db, permissions, mail, validation)
  - /server (actions or route handlers)
- Use Zod for validation.
- Use server actions for mutations where appropriate.
- Add basic test coverage: at least 5 unit tests for permission checks and anonymity logic (Vitest or Jest).
- Add linting/formatting configs.
- Provide README with setup steps and env vars.

DELIVERABLES (OUTPUT FORMAT)
1) Generate the complete project codebase with all files.
2) Include a README.md with:
   - Local setup (Docker Postgres)
   - Prisma migrate/seed
   - Resend/Postmark config
   - Vercel deploy notes
3) Provide .env.example
4) Provide a “Demo script” markdown section describing how to click through the MVP in 5 minutes.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
- Start by planning the routes, DB schema, and permission matrix.
- Then implement auth + multi-tenancy + seed.
- Then Admin: people, templates, cycles.
- Then nomination workflow + rater token flow.
- Then reporting + anonymity threshold.
- Then email notifications.

CONSTRAINTS
- Finish in one pass. Do not ask questions. Make reasonable defaults.
- Prioritize correctness, clean UX, and a premium look over extra features.
- If you must cut scope: keep multi-tenant, cycles, nominations, token raters, and reports.

Now build it.
